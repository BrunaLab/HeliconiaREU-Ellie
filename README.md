# Project Description

Working to understand the limitations of the modeling technique used in the @BrunaLab exploration of the lagged effects of climate variables on Helicona life history by:

1. Running the GAM on increasingly smaller samples of plants from the full Heliconia dataset

2. Running the GAM on increasingly smaller peroids of time from the full Heliconia dataset

3. Combine the two first steps
